My name is Dimitra Giantsidi and I am a PhD student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), member of [Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa), supervised by Prof. [Pramod Bhatotia](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). 

For my PhD, I am investigating ways to re-desing high-end distributed transactional systems in order to establish trust by leveraging off-the-selft trusted hardware modules. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research.

Before joining ICSA, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece. During my diploma thesis, I joined [CSLAB](http://research.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/) where I worked with Dr. [Kostis Nikas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~knikas/), Dr. [Vasileios Karakostas](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/) and Prof. [Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/). In parallel with the last year of my
studies I worked as a Research Software Engineer in the [NFV Accelerator Project at Intracom Telecom, Greece](http://www.intracom-telecom.com/en/products/telco_software/sdn_nfv/sdn_nfv.htm).

**Interests**: Distributed and Database Systems, Secure Transaction Processing, File Systems, Intel SGX, Operating Systems, Parallel Architectures, Memory System.
