I am a PhD student at [<span style="color:black">The University of Edinburgh (UoE)</span>](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), member of the [<span style="color:black">Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</span>](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) and the [<span style="color:black">Chair of Decentralized Systems Engineering (DSE)</span>](https://dse.in.tum.de/people/), supervised by Prof. [<span style="color:black">Pramod Bhatotia</span>](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). 

For my PhD, I am investigating ways to re-desing high-end distributed transactional systems in order to establish trust by leveraging modern trusted hardware modules. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research.

Before joining UoE, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in [<span style="color:black">National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)</span>](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece. During my diploma thesis, I joined [<span style="color:black">CSLAB</span>](http://research.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/) where I worked with Dr. [<span style="color:black">Kostis Nikas</span>](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~knikas/), Dr. [<span style="color:black">Vasileios Karakostas</span>](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/) and Prof. [<span style="color:black">Georgios Goumas</span>](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/). In parallel with the last year of my
studies I worked as a Research Software Engineer in the [<span style="color:black">NFV Accelerator Project at Intracom Telecom, Greece</span>](http://www.intracom-telecom.com/en/products/telco_software/sdn_nfv/sdn_nfv.htm).
