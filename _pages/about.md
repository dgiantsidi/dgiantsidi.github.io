I am a PhD student at [<span style="color:black">the University of Edinburgh (UoE)</span>](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), member of the [<span style="color:black">Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</span>](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) and the [<span style="color:black"> Chair of Distributed and Operating Systems</span>](https://dse.in.tum.de/team/), supervised by Prof. [<span style="color:black">Pramod Bhatotia</span>](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). 

For my PhD, I am exploring ways to improve the security properties of widely-used software systems (e.g., distributed datastores and transactions, storage systems, replicated KV stores) leveraging the advances in trusted hardware. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research and UK Rise.

Before joining ICSA, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [<span style="color:black">NTUA</span>](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece.


**Interests**: Distributed and dependable systems, transactional datastores, replication protocols, storage architectures, Intel SGX, operating systems, parallel architectures.

**BSc/MSc students**: You can browse [<span style="color:black">here</span>](./thesis_topics.pdf) for a list of potential thesis topics.
