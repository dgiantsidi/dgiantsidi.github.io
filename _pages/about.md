I like to build robust and efficient distributed systems!

I am currently a Researcher at [<span style="color:black">Azure Research (Security and Privacy Group)</span>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-security-privacy/) where I work on the next-generation secure storage stacks and filesystems. I got my PhD student from the [<span style="color:black">the University of Edinburgh (UoE)</span>](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) where I focused on the dependable distributed data management systems leveraging the state-of-the-art hardware in confidential computing (e.g., TEEs, CVMs) and networking (direct I/O and SmartNICs). During my PhD I interned twice at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK and Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA, USA. I also served as a Research Assistant and a member of the [<span style="color:black">Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</span>](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) and the [<span style="color:black"> Chair of Distributed and Operating Systems</span>](https://dse.in.tum.de/team/), advised by Prof. [<span style="color:black">Pramod Bhatotia</span>](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). 

My research focuses on leveraging the state-of-the-art trusted hardware to design and build secure, robust and effiecient software systems, ranging from distributed datastores, transactions and storage systems to replicated KV stores. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research and UK Rise.

Before joining ICSA, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [<span style="color:black">NTUA</span>](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece.

**Interests**: Distributed and dependable systems, filesystems, transactional datastores, replication protocols, storage architectures.
