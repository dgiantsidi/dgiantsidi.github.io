I am a PhD student at [<span style="color:black">The University of Edinburgh (UoE)</span>](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), member of the [<span style="color:black">Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</span>](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) and the [<span style="color:black">Chair of Decentralized Systems Engineering (DSE)</span>](https://dse.in.tum.de/people/), supervised by Prof. [<span style="color:black">Pramod Bhatotia</span>](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). 

For my PhD, I am exploring ways to improve the security properties of widely-used software systems (e.g., distributed datastores and transactions, storage systems, replicated KV stores) leveraging the advances in trusted hardware. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research and UK Rise.

Before joining ICSA, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [<span style="color:black">NTUA</span>](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece.

#During my diploma thesis, I joined [<span style="color:black">CSLAB</span>](http://research.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/) where I worked with Dr. [<span style="color:black">Kostis Nikas</span>](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~knikas/), Dr. [<span style="color:black">Vasileios Karakostas</span>](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/) and Prof. [<span style="color:black">Georgios Goumas</span>](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/). In parallel with the last year of my
#studies I worked as a Research Software Engineer in the [<span style="color:black">NFV Accelerator Project at Intracom Telecom, Greece</span>](http://www.intracom-telecom.com/en/products/telco_software/sdn_nfv/sdn_nfv.htm).

**Interests**: Distributed and dependable systems, transactional datastores, replication protocols, storage architectures, Intel SGX, operating systems, parallel architectures.
