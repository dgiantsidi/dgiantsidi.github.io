My name is Dimitra Giantsidi and I am a PhD student at the (University of Edinburgh)[https://www.ed.ac.uk/], member of (Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA))[http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa], supervised by Prof. [Pramod Bhatotia](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). For my PhD, I am investigating ways to make transactional database systems secure by leveraging trusted hardware modules. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research.

Before joining ICSA, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece. During my diploma thesis, I joined [CSLAB](http://research.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/) where I worked with Dr. [Kostis Nikas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~knikas/), Dr. [Vasileios Karakostas](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/~vkarakos/) and Prof. [Georgios Goumas](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~goumas/).
