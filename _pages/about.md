I like to build robust and efficient distributed systems!

I am currently a Research Assistant and a final-year  PhD student at [<span style="color:black">the University of Edinburgh (UoE)</span>](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), member of the [<span style="color:black">Institute for Computing Systems Architecture (ICSA)</span>](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) and the [<span style="color:black"> Chair of Distributed and Operating Systems</span>](https://dse.in.tum.de/team/), advised by Prof. [<span style="color:black">Pramod Bhatotia</span>](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pbhatoti/). 

My research focuses on leveraging the state-of-the-art trusted hardware to design and build secure, robust and effiecient software systems, ranging from distributed datastores, transactions and storage systems to replicated KV stores. My research is sponsored by Microsoft Research and UK Rise.

Before joining ICSA, I graduated from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [<span style="color:black">NTUA</span>](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece.


**Interests**: Distributed and dependable systems, transactional datastores, replication protocols, storage architectures, Intel SGX, operating systems, parallel architectures.
